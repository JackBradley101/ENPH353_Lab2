# Chat promtpts & what I thought useful

## initial ideas

I have this video, where it shows the POV of a robot running on a road. I want to use openCV to track the road, and place a red dot at the center of the road on the most bottob region in the frame. what are some methods we can use here, and are there any useful pre-built functionaliies in openCV that will be useful in this setup.
